# Home Mortgage Disclosure Act - Data Analysis
This project was done for one of my early Data Science courses.  It was my introduction to scikit-learn.  I did some interesting (to me, at least) work plotting shapefiles in python; though I imagine there are far easier methods for plotting data at a census tract level.

The HMDA dataset is large (1.5 million loan application records).

As this was my first project in python, this project did not incorporate the pipeline and grid search functionality that I have since used.
